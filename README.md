# My Projects Hub ~everything at one place

This project is a single-page HTML portfolio that showcases a collection of all my web projects developed over 4 years of study.

## Why a Single HTML File?
- **Centralized Showcase:** I wanted a single, easy-to-share page where anyone can browse all my major and mini-projects at once.
- **Simplicity:** No backend, no build tools just open the file and see everything.
- **Portability:** You can host it anywhere (GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or even locally) and it will work.
- **Quick Access:** All project links, descriptions, and badges are in one place, making it easy for recruiters, friends, or collaborators to explore my work.

## Features
- **Modern, Responsive UI:** Clean design with cards for each project, badges for real-world problem solving, and a dark/light theme toggle.
- **Live Project Links:** Each card links directly to the live deployed version of the project.
- **Project Descriptions:** Short summaries and icons for each project.
- **No Dependencies:** Just open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customization
- To add or update projects, simply edit the HTML and add a new `.project-card` block.
- You can update icons, links, and descriptions as your portfolio grows.
